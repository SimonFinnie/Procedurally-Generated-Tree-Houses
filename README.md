# Procedurally-Generated-Tree-Houses
Blender Python based procedural model generation for a tree with a tree house loosely based on Lothlórien from Lord of the rings. This was developed as part of an assignment from university.
The 3D models were produced from singular vertices extrudions using combinations of algebraic expressions to produce unconventional  shapes, which can be used to develop impressive models. 

To run these you need to call them in a blender python enviornment, which means you require a copy of blender in your directory. The method allows you to choose the scale of the treehouse in each of the x,y,z directions using an integer scaling system. From there the proceduaral generation will develop a tree building to fit those parameters. x and y parameters should be made equal in the current formation to avoid unusual looking buildings.
The current version was made with a singular naming convention, and so only one can be built at a time. Due to time constraints this was not updated, but the update will be easily implimented.
Future development includes updated building generation to include some more features to the building, a walkway generator, and having the building spread into a community as the inputed width increase.
